"- [xbps-query(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-query.1) searches for and\n"

"   `-R` flag, packages contained in repositories.\n"
"- [xbps-install(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-install.1) installs and\n"
"   updates packages, and syncs repository indexes.\n"
"- [xbps-remove(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-remove.1) removes installed\n"
"   packages, and can also remove orphaned packages and cached package files.\n"
"- [xbps-reconfigure(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-reconfigure.1) runs the\n"
"   configuration steps for installed packages, and can be used to reconfigure\n"
"   certain packages after changes in their configuration files. The latter\n"
"   usually requires the `--force` flag.\n"
"- [xbps-alternatives(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-alternatives.1) lists or\n"
"   sets the alternatives provided by installed packages. Alternatives is a\n"
"   system which allows multiple packages to provide common functionality through\n"
"   otherwise conflicting files, by creating symlinks from the common paths to\n"
"   package-specific versions that are selected by the user.\n"
"- [xbps-pkgdb(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-pkgdb.1) can report and fix\n"
"   issues in the package database, as well as modify it.\n"
"- [xbps-rindex(1)](https://man.voidlinux.org/xbps-rindex.1) manages local binary\n"
