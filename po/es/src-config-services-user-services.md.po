"Sometimes it can be nice to have user-specific runit services. For example, "
"you might want to open an ssh tunnel as the current user, run a virtual "
"machine, or regularly run daemons on your behalf. The most common way to do "
"this is to create a system-level service that runs [runsvdir(8)](https://man."
"voidlinux.org/runsvdir.8) as your user, in order to start and monitor the "
"services in a personal services directory."

"In this example [chpst(8)](https://man.voidlinux.org/chpst.8) is used to "
"start a new [runsvdir(8)](https://man.voidlinux.org/runsvdir.8) process as "
"the specified user. [chpst(8)](https://man.voidlinux.org/chpst.8) does not "
"read groups on its own, but expects the user to list all required groups "
"separated by a `:`. The `id` and `tr` pipe is used to create a list of all "
"the user's groups in a way [chpst(8)](https://man.voidlinux.org/chpst.8) "
"understands it. Note that we export `$USER` and `$HOME` because some user "
"services may not work without them."

"The user can then create new services or symlinks to them in the `/home/"

"(https://man.voidlinux.org/sv.8) command, the user can specify the services "
"by path, or by name if the `SVDIR` environment variable is set to the user's "
"services directory. This is shown in the following examples:"
