"musl practices very strict and minimal standard compliance. Many commonly "
"used platform-specific extensions are not present. Because of this, it is "
"common for software to need modification to compile and/or function "
"properly. Void developers work to patch such software and hopefully get "
"portability/correctness changes accepted into the upstream projects."
