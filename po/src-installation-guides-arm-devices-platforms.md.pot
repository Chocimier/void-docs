"The `rpi-kernel` packages for all Raspberry Pi variants are built from the "

"packages should be installed if you want to use any DKMS packages. Void "
"ships `rpi-base` meta-packages that install the relevant `rpi-kernel` and "
"`rpi-firmware` packages. Together, these packages enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth "
