"Welcome to the Void Handbook! Please be sure to read the \"[About This "

"Void is an independent, [rolling release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Rolling_release) Linux distribution, developed from scratch rather than as a "
"fork, with a focus on stability over [bleeding-edge](https://en.wikipedia."
"org/wiki/Bleeding_edge_technology). In addition, there are several features "
"that make Void unique:"

"- The [XBPS](https://github.com/void-linux/xbps) package manager, which is\n"
"   extremely fast, developed in-house, and performs checks when installing\n"
"   updates to ensure that libraries are not changed to incompatible versions\n"
"   which can break dependencies.\n"
"- The [musl libc](https://musl.libc.org/), which focuses on standards compliance\n"
"   and correctness, has first class support. This allows us to build certain\n"
"   components for musl systems statically, which would not be practical on glibc\n"
"   systems.\n"
"- The [LibreSSL](https://www.libressl.org/) fork is used instead of the mainline\n"
"   OpenSSL library. Developed as part of the OpenBSD project, LibreSSL is\n"
"   dedicated to the security, quality, and maintainability of this critical\n"
"   library.\n"
"- [runit](../config/services/index.md) is used for\n"
"   [init(8)](https://man.voidlinux.org/init.8) and service supervision. This\n"
"   allows Void to support musl as a second libc choice, which would not be\n"
"   possible with [systemd](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/).\n"
"   A side effect of this decision is a core system with clean and efficient\n"
"   operation, and a small code base.\n"
