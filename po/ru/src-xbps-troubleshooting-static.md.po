"In rare cases, it is possible to break the system sufficiently that XBPS can "
"no longer function. This usually happens while trying to do unsupported "
"things with libc, but can also happen when an update contains a corrupt "
"glibc archive or otherwise fails to unpack and configure fully."

"Another issue that can present itself is in systems with a XBPS version "
"before `0.54` (released June 2019). These systems will be impossible to "
"update from the official repositories using the regular update procedure, "
"due a change in the compression format used for repository data, which was "
"made in March 2020."

"The tools in the static set are identical to the normal ones found on most "
"systems. The only distinction is that these tools are statically linked to "
"the musl C library, and should work on systems where nothing else does. In "
"systems where the platform can no longer boot, it is recommended to chroot "
"in with Void installation media and use the static tools from there, as it "
"is unlikely that even a shell will work correctly on the target system. When "
"using static XBPS with glibc installation, environmental variable "
"`XBPS_ARCH` need to be set."
