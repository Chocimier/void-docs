"Packages can be restricted from distribution by either the upstream author "
"or Void. Void reserves the right to restrict distribution of any package for "
"effectively any reason, massive size being the most common. Another common "
"reason is restrictive licensing that does not allow third-party "
"redistribution of source or binary packages."
