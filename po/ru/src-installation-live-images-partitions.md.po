"Partitioning for a modern Linux distribution is generally very simple, "
"however the introduction of GPT and UEFI booting does bring new complexity "
"to the process. When creating your new partition table you will need a "
"partition for the root filesystem, along with a swap partition and possibly "
"another partition or two to facilitate booting, if required."

"Note that if the disk has already been initialized, the top of the `cfdisk` "
"screen will show the partition layout already present: `Label: dos` for the "
"MBR scheme, `Label: gpt` for the GPT scheme. If you just want to erase the "
"partition table before starting the installer, use `wipefs(8)`. Otherwise, "
"you can run `cfdisk(8)` manually with the `-z` option to start with an "
"uninitialized disk layout; `cfdisk` will prompt you for the label type "
"before continuing to the main screen."
