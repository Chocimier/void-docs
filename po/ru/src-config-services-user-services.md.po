"Sometimes it can be nice to have user-specific runit services. For example, "
"you might want to open an ssh tunnel as the current user, run a virtual "
"machine, or regularly run daemons on your behalf. The most common way to do "
"this is to create a system-level service that runs [runsvdir(8)](https://man."
"voidlinux.org/runsvdir.8) as your user, in order to start and monitor the "
"services in a personal services directory."
