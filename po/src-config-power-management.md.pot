"The `acpid` service for [acpid(8)](https://man.voidlinux.org/acpid.8) is "
"installed and, if Void was installed from a live image using the local "
"source, will be enabled by default. ACPI events are handled by `/etc/acpi/"
"handler.sh`, which uses [zzz(8)](https://man.voidlinux.org/zzz.8) for "
"suspend-to-RAM events."

"The `elogind` service is provided by the `elogind` package. By default, "
"[elogind(8)](https://man.voidlinux.org/elogind.8) listens for, and "
"processes, ACPI events related to lid-switch activation and the *power*, "
"*suspend* and *hibernate* keys. This will conflict with the `acpid` service "
"if it is installed and enabled. Either disable `acpid` when enabling "
"`elogind`, or configure `elogind` to `ignore` ACPI events in [logind.conf(5)]"
"(https://man.voidlinux.org/logind.conf.5). There are several configuration "
"options, all starting with the keyword `Handle`, that should be set to "
"`ignore` to avoid interfering with `acpid`."
